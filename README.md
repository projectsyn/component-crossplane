## Local installation for testing purposes

The target installs the component Crossplane in a local cluster. This component uses [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator#quickstart).

Note: the namespace in the ClusterRoleBinding needs to be updated as we're deploying in a namespace other than the default namespace, that's why we have `kind/prometheus-operator-cluster-role-binding.yaml`
